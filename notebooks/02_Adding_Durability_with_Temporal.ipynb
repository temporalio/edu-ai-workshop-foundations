    "Imagine this: Your application conducts expensive research through an LLM call (costing time and money), but then **crashes** during PDF generation due to a network outage. When you restart, everything is lost. You're back to the beginning, paying for the same LLM call again, making your users wait, and burning through your API budget.\n",
